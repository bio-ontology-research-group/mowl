    with Phenotype Annotations \

    annotations were obtained from the \

    document. These annotations were added to the *Unified Phenotype Ontology* (uPheno) to build \
    the training ontology. Futhermore, gene-disease associations were obtained from the \
    `Associations of Mouse Genes with DO Diseases \
    <http://www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/MGI_DO.rpt>`_ file, from which associations \
    for human and mouse were extracted (to build separate datasets) and each of them were \
    randomly split 80:10:10, added to the training ontology and created the validation and \
    testing ontologies, respectively.
